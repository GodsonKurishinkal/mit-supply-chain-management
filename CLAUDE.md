- `02-SC2x-Supply-Chain-Design/` - Network design, facility location, capacity planning
- `03-SC3x-Supply-Chain-Dynamics/` - Bullwhip effect, coordination, risk management
- `04-SC4x-Supply-Chain-Technology-Systems/` - ERP, digital transformation
- `05-SC5x-Supply-Chain-Analytics/` - Advanced analytics, ML in supply chains
- `06-CFx-Comprehensive-Exam/` - Final exam preparation
- `99-Resources/` - Shared resources, case studies, datasets

## Course Subfolders
Each course folder contains:
- `assignments/` - Homework and problem sets
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with code and analysis
- `resources/` - Course materials, readings, references

## Commands
- Activate environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start Jupyter: `jupyter lab`

## Key Libraries
- **numpy, pandas** - Data manipulation
- **matplotlib, seaborn, plotly** - Visualization
- **statsmodels, prophet** - Time series forecasting
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning
- **pulp, ortools** - Optimization
